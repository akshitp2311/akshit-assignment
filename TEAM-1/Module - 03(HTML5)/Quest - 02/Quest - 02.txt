Quest :-How to embed audio and video in a webpage?

Ans :-	HTML5 features include native audio and video support without the need for Flash.
	The HTML5 <audio> and <video> tags make it simple to add media to a website. 
	You need to set src attribute to identify the media source and include a controls attribute so the 
	user can play and pause the media.
	
	*Embedding Video
	Here is the simplest form of embedding a video file in your webpage −

	<video src = "foo.mp4"  width = "300" height = "200" controls>
   		Your browser does not support the <video> element.   
	</video>
	
	The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which video formats browsers should support 
	in the video tag. But most commonly used video formats are −

	Ogg − Ogg files with Thedora video codec and Vorbis audio codec.
	mpeg4 − MPEG4 files with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec.

	*Embedding Audio
	HTML5 supports <audio> tag which is used to embed sound content in an HTML or XHTML document as follows.

	<audio src = "foo.wav" controls autoplay>
   		Your browser does not support the <audio> element.   
	</audio>

	The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which audio formats browsers should support in the audio tag. 
	But most commonly used audio formats are ogg, mp3 and wav.

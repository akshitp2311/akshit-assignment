Quest-01:-Define the terms: Website, Webpage, Web browser, Web server, HTML, CSS
Ans:-	Web page
	A web page is a simple document displayable by a browser. Such documents are written in the HTML language 
	(which we look into in more detail in other articles). A web page can embed a variety of different types of 
	resources such as:

	style information — controlling a page's look-and-feel
	scripts — which add interactivity to the page
	media — images, sounds, and videos.
	
	Web site
	A website is a collection of linked web pages (plus their associated resources) that share a unique domain name. 
	Each web page of a given website provides explicit links—most of the time in the form of clickable portions of text—that 
	allow the user to move from one page of the website to another.

	Web server
	A web server is a computer hosting one or more websites. "Hosting" means that all the web pages and their supporting 
	files are available on that computer. The web server will send any web page from the website it is hosting to any user's 
	browser, per user request

	Search engine
	Search engines are a common source of confusion on the web. A search engine is a special kind of website that helps 
	users find web pages from other websites.

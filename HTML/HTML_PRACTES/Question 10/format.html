        <abbr title="">HTML</abbr>  elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br /> 
        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as 
        <em><strong> headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.</strong></em><br /> 
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <u>angle brackets.</u>  
        Tags such as &lt;img/ &gt; and &lt; input/ &gt; directly introduce content into the page.<br /> 
        Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.<br /> 
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
